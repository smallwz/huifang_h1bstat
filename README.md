This is the project repo. Here are some instructions on running the script. 

1. My bash script run.sh use python3 to run python as follows: 
   $ python3 ./src/h1bStat.py
   If the test system use different name, please change to the right name. Then compile it and run:
   $ chmod +x run.sh
   $ ./run.sh

2. The python script h1bStat.py currently reads h1b_input.csv dataset.
   I also tested with 2016 (H1B_FY_2016.csv), 2015 and 2014 data. If you want to test those datasets, please make change on line 13. # huifang_h1bstat
